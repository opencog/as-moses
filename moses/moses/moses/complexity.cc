// For a Boolean formula, the complexity is the neg(# of literals)
// That is, a Boolean formula can always be reduced to CNF or DNF,
// and, in that case, the complexity is "almost" a linear function
// of the number of arguments -- well, at least, its sub-quadratic,
// if we did decide to count the operators.  (XXX But why  not count
// the operators?  For ENF (elegant normal form) there should be even
// fewer operators than either CNF or DNF, so counting operators
// doesn't seem wrong to me ...)
//
// XXX What is the complexity of contin expressions?
// Expressions containining greater_than_zero, impulse, cond?  I'm
// somwhat confused about how thigs are being measured.   Note that
// when we calculate the complexity of a field_set, then contins
// count for more than one, depending on the number of "digits" in them.
// And, in a field set, operators are disc_knobs, and so they are
// counted there ...
//
// Soooo... Is this complexity supposed to mirror that of the field
// set -- i.e. lots-of-knobs==higher-complexity?  That probably means
// we should count logical and, logical_or, below ..!?!? TODO, clarify.
// (grep for "information_theoretic_bits" in optimization.h)
//
// Note Bene: this function returns a POSITIVE number!
