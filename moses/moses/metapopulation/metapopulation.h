/**
 * The metapopulation stores a pool of combo trees that are drawn from
 * during the learning process.  The pool is expanded by adding the
 * expressions (the combo trees) that were generated during the deme
 * expansion and optimization step.
 *
 * The metapopulation is updated in iterations. In each iteration, one
 * of its elements is selected as an exemplar. The exemplar is then
 * decorated with knobs and optimized, to create a new deme.  Suitably
 * high-scoring members of the deme (instances) are then explicitly
 * converted into trees, and folded back into the metapopulation.  At
 * this point, the metapopulation may be pruned, to keep it's size
 * manageable.
 *
 * Again, the primary purpose of the metapopulation is to provide a
 * well-balanced, evenly-distributed collection of exemplars for future
 * expansion into demes.  The metapopulation does NOT have to consist
 * of the very best possible combo trees; rather, it must consist of
 * the kinds of combo trees that will generate the fittest offspring,
 * when expanded. It can be thought of as a kind of "breeding stock".
 *
 * The metapopulation should be contrasted with the ensemble, which
 * also holds a colection of scored combo trees.  The explicit goal of
 * the ensemble is to gather together the fittest combo trees (the most
 * predictive, accurate, precise trees). Although, in general, the two
 * are likely to hold similar sets of trees, the management policy for
 * the ensemble and the metapopulation differ; the ensemble will be used
 * for inference, the metapopulation for breeding.
 *
 * XXX FIXME: right now, the ensemble is attached to the metapop, its
 * kind-of coming along for the ride, because that's easier for now.
 * Someday, it should have an independent existance.
 *
 * A number of different approaches are taken to maintain a well-balanced,
 * evenly-distributed collection of exemplars.  One of these is the
 * "diversity" mechanism, which seeks to ensure that the distribution
 * stays as diverse as possible, by means of a "diversity penalty",
 * which enables low-scoring combo trees to be kept around, without being
 * crowded out by higher-scoring rivals. The point here is that it is
 * often the case that low-scoring, unfit combo trees can generate very
 * high-fitness offspring.
