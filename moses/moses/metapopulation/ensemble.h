/**
 * The ensemble holds a collection of the fittest combo trees.  The
 * goal of the ensemble is to provide the best (most accurate, most
 * predictive) model of the training data.  The ensemble is meant to
 * be creted during training, and used for inference after training.
 *
 * The ensemble should be contrasted with the metapopulation, which
 * also holds a collection of combo trees. However, the metapopulation
 * is meant to do something different: to provide the 'breeding stock'
 * for deme expansion and optimization.  Therefore, the metapopulation
 * management policy is different from the ensemble, although it is
 * likely that the two will hold similar contents. The ensemble is
 * intended for inference; the metapopulation for breeding.
 *
 * In particular (depending on parameters), the ensemble is designed to
 * hold a boosted collection of combo trees.  A boosted set of trees
 * only makes sense when the set was generated using a consistent
 * algorithm, admitting only certain specific members. This differs
 * from the metapopulation, which has no particular admission criteria.
 *
 * XXX FIXME: right now, the ensemble is attached to the metapop, its
 * kind-of coming along for the ride, because that's easier for now.
 * Someday, it should have an independent existance.
