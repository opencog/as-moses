/**
 * Composite score calculated from the behavioral score.
 *
 * The score is calculated as the sum of the bscore over all samples:
 *      score = sum_x BScore(x) + penalty
 *
 * Each element in the bscore typically corresponds to a sample in a
 * supervised training set, that is, a row of a table contianing the
 * training data.
 *
 * This is a "minor" helper class, and exists for three reasons:
 * 1) avoids some redundancy of having the summation in many places
 * 2) Helps with keeping the score-caching code cleaner.
 * 3) When boosting, the summation above is no longer just a simple sum.
