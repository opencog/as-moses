 * Fitness function for selecting a range of rows from a continuous-
 * valued distribution.  The range of rows selected are expressed as
 * percentiles. That is, if the input table has N rows, then rows that
 * are selected will be rows N*lower_percentile through N*upper_percentile,
 * where the rows are ordered in ascending rank of the output column.
 * That is, this scorer will rank (sort) the rows according to the
 * output column, and then select those only in the indicated range.
 * If 'positive' is false, then the rows are ranked in reverse order.
 *
 * The 'hardness' indicates just how sharp it selection will be TBD.
 * Not yet implemented.
