/**
 * This file implements a combo tree similarity measure, obtained by
 * directly comparing combo trees.  It differs strongly from a
 * behavioral-score based similarity measure, in the two xausual ways:
 * two very different trees could produce very similar or even identical
 * behavioural scores, and two very similar trees could have very
 * wildly different scores.  Thus, the similarity measured here provides
 * a different viewpoint to a behavioral-score similarity. Roughly
 * speaking, its like comparing genotypes instead of pheontypes.
 *
 * The tree similarity measure implemented here is described by:
 * Rui Yang, Panos Kalnis, Anthony K. H. Tung
 * "Similarity Evaluation on Tree-structured Data"
 * appearning in SIGMOD 2005.
 * http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~atung/renmin/treematch.pdf
 *
 * Roughly, the algo words as follows:
 *
 * A) Given a combo expression such as "+(a b c d)", convert it to
 *    a binary tree: e.g. "+(a +(b +(c d)))"  This proceedure is
 *    applied recursively to subtrees.
 *
 * B) Define a "tree branch" as a node and its two immediate children.
 *    The above example has the following tree branches: "+(a +)"
 *    and "+(b +)" and "+(c d)". For this example, each of thes occurs
 *    only once.
 *
 * C) Count how many times each kind of tree branch occurs in the binary
 *    tree. This dictionary of branch-type vs. count can be thought of
 *    as a vector if it was sorted, e.g. lexicographically.
 *
 * D) The similarity of two trees is *defined* as the Manhattan or lp_1
 *    distance between the two dictionaries (or vectors).
 *
 * Commentary:
 *
 * The pdf above provides a proof that this similarity measure is a
 * lower bound for a certain kind of tree-edit distance. However, it
 * is not at all clear that "tree-edit distance" is the correct way
 * to compare combo trees.  There are multiple reasons for this:
 *
 * a) The combo trees +(a b) and +(b a) are functionally equivalent,
 *    but are separated by a non-zero tree-edit distance.  They are
 *    also judged different by the code below.  Thus, the code below
 *    will work best if both trees have been passed through reduct,
 *    thus normalizing them for such differences.
 *
 * b) The combo trees +($a $b) and +($a $c) seem obviously different,
 *    but what if $b and $c are features that are highly correlated?
 *    Thus, the "true" distance probably has to be adjusted by such
 *    correlations.
 *
 * c) The tree-edit distance (and the distnace used here) between the
 *    combo trees "fold(f [] a b c d e)" and  "fold(g [] a b c d e)
 *    would seem to be small: differing only by the applied function
 *    f vs g.  But these can be very wildly different functions, so
 *    what is the "true" diffference between these trees?
 *
 * Thus, the similarity defined here seems to be no better and no worse
 * than comparing combo trees via some tree-edit distance.  its an
 * imperfect measure but, lacking a clearer defintiion of the "genotype"
 * of a combo tree, there does not seem to be any way of much improving
 * in this measure.
 *
 * Note: There are various changes and departures from the algo
 * described in the PDF:
 *
 * 1) We never need the binary tree version of a tree, and so never
 *    generate that.  Instead, we generate the branch-tree vector
 *    directly.
 * 2) Empty nodes are never generated; they're not needed.
 * 2) Leaf nodes are not generated. This is a fairly significant
 *    departure from the original algorithm.  It does alter the
 *    distance measure for tree similarity; our trees are measured
 *    'closer' than the original algo, by about a factor of 2.
 *    I beleive that this difference won't affect results by much;
 *    it will save cpu time, though.
 * 4) We don't actually need a C++ vector to hold the vector. An
 *    std::map (a dictionary) is easier.
