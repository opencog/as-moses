DESCRIPTION
-----------
Scripts to extract MOSES out of OpenCog project, and replace GPL
license by Apache (MOSES has double licensing).


Extraction
----------

To extract MOSES from OpenCog use the script OC2MOSES.sh. The usage is

    $ ./OC2MOSES.sh MOSES_DIR

MOSES_DIR is the name of the directory to create and place the MOSES
project.  Non-standard locations of the OpenCog project can be dealt
with by hacking the OC_PATH setting in the shell script.

For example,

    $ ./OC2MOSES.sh moses-3.0.9

It will create a directory moses-3.0.9 with a standalone version of
MOSES in it.


RPM Build and Installation
--------------------------
The MOSES system may be built to create an RPM package, so as to ease
installation and version management.  Be sure to create a ~/.rpmmacros
file for yourself, and review general RPM build proceedures.  The spec
file is called moses.spec.

    $ cp moses-x.y.z.tar.bz2 wherever/rpmbuild
    $ cp moses.spec wherever/rpmbuild/SPECS
    $ cd wherever/rpmbuild/SPECS
    $ rpmbuild -bb moses.spec


Manual Installation
-------------------
For a manual compile and install, perform the following from the 
extracted directory:

    $ cd moses-3.0.9

To compile:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

Install (requires root privilege)

    # make install
    # ldconfig
