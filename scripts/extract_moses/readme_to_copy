INTRODUCTION
------------
MOSES is an evolutionary program learner. It is mostly based on Moshe
Looks' thesis, "Competent Porgram Evolution", 2006 (Washington
University, Missouri) http://metacog.org/main.pdf. Moshe is also the
primary author of the code.


LICENSE
-------
This is a standalone version of MOSES, covered by the Apache 2.0 license.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
The following packages are needed to build moses:
-- (mandatory) libboost 1.46 or later.
-- (optional) MPI, either MPICH2 or OpenMPI.


RPM Build and Installation
--------------------------
The MOSES system may be built to create an RPM package, so as to ease
installation and version management.  Be sure to create a ~/.rpmmacros
file for yourself, and review general RPM build proceedures.  The spec
file is called moses.spec.

$ rpmbuild -bb moses.spec


Manual Installation
-------------------
Alternately, one may manually compile and install.  To compile, go to
the root directory of MOSES:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Install (requires root privileges)

# make install
# ldconfig
